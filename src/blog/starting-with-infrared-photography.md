description: What is infrared photography? How I got started. And what you need to know to start.

Never did I think a photo of a tree in parking lot would look so magical. While that description sounds like something out of young adult fantasy novel (no shame, love those), that's how I'd describe the first infrared (IR) photo I took.

I know this isn't the most impressive picture, but the fact that this was what my live-view showed, that was fascinating. I couldn't believe my eyes. I went on an hour photo walk and instantly became hooked.

## What's IR Photography?
Perhaps, like me, you're curious about how this was all possible. The human eye can only see a small part of the light spectrum. We see this light reflected in the form of color. IR photography captures light not visible by the human eye, by using IR converted cameras and filters. 

## What's different about IR cameras?
By default modern digital cameras capture light a a full spectrum. This means they see light beyond what humans can see. To capture "normal colors", manufactures install a what's called a hot mirror, which filters out non visible light. In order to capture IR photographs, the hot mirror must be removed. A few places offer camera conversion services, two of the most popular are: [Kolari Vision](https://kolarivision.com/) and [Lifepixel](https://www.lifepixel.com/?ar=65)

## How do I choose a camera?
Conversion service providers often have lists of cameras that can be converted, but you can convert a DSLR, mirrorless, or point-and-shoot camera. Some images are best captured in RAW format, so you can more easily pull colors in post-processing. You can also shoot JPEG, and get great photos for certain filters, for example a 590nm filter.

One big consideration is that standard DSLR viewfinders don't focus IR photos well, nor do they show the colors captured by IR. Make sure to get a camera with live view option and/or a [digital view finder](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-digital-camera-viewfinder-4777338).

If you are thinking of getting a camera with interchangeable lenses, you may also want to consider that some lenses produce hotspots, which appear as bright spots on your photos. These are inconvenient and hard to remove. There's a few ways to avoid them, but one place to start is by choosing a lens that is less likely to produce these. I like to use [Kolari's list of lenses](https://kolarivision.com/lens-hotspot-list/) as a place to start when researching lenses.

### Start small, then upgrade
The first IR camera I used was a Canon M50 Mark II, which I rented from as part of a one day workshop provided by Boston Pathography Workshops. If you're near that area, check it out!

After class, I didn't want to invest in converting a mirrorless or a DSLR camera just yet. Therefore, for my first IR camera I purchased a Kolari Pocket, which is a digital point and shoot that Kolari has converted into a full-spectrum camera. It also offers a couple of additional features, such as the ability to change filters, and the option to shoot RAW with the use of a [CHDK enabled SD Card](http://kolarivision.com/articles/chdk/). 

I'll be writing my own review on the camera soon. In the mean time, check out this review by Robert Shea.

## Can I revert the conversion process?
Once a camera is converted, you can't *un*-convert it. However, for a full-spectrum camera, you can purchase a hot mirror filter, which blocks out infrared light and lets you capture standard pictures. 

If you go for a partial conversion, you may not be able to do this. A partial conversion means that another filter is installed in place of the hot mirror. This limits your photos to the light captured by that filter. 

With full-spectrum, you get all types of light, and you can purchase filters separately to control what light you see. Why would someone go for a partial conversion then? Filters can be expensive, and some photographers prefer a specific look.

## How I choose a filter? How does it work?
Light forms part of what is known as the eleLight waves are measured in nanometers (nm). IR filters work by blocking out light at a certain spectrum. That's why you'll see IR filters often named based on nanometers. 

You can select a filter based on the color effect you're seeking. I'm still experimenting with filters, and plan to offer insights as I go.  If you're curious, Kolari has a whole [article on selecting filters](https://kolarivision.com/articles/choosing-a-filter/), including photos. Do note that this article does not cover all possible looks that you can get when manipulating color channels in post-processing.

## What's a good IR subject?
Try experimenting with different light and subjects to see what you like. But there's a few general tips you can follow. 

Shooting in direct sunlight typically offers high contrast IR photos. As IR photos tend to have low contrast, direct sunlight and sunny mid-day conditions are often recommended. 

You can also get great results by matching an organic material with an inorganic material. Organic materials will often reflect lots of infrared light, giving them interesting colors, whereas inorganic materials will often appear more washed out or dark (specific colors depend on the filter). Combining the two subjects yields some dramatic effects. This is why you often see IR pictures of trees and mountains, or trees and buildings.

In the picture below, the sailboats had red sails, but they appear fully white. You can see that people also have a ghostly white look.

## Does this require a lot of post-processing work?
It can, but not necessarily. As I said, some forms of IR photography look great with JPEG, and you may not even need to edit them. That said shooting RAW, and learning your way around color manipulation, can offer many more possibilities, and help you grow as a photographer.

## Can I try IR without a converted camera?
Yes! You can do so by purchasing a 720nm filter. This will give you the standard black and white IR look. For other types of IR photos, you will need a converted camera. Also note that this method will require a long exposure, so you will need a tripod.

What I've just shared with you are the few takeaways and lessons I've gathered since first picking up an IR camera at the start of July. I hope my beginner mindset has helped clarify some of the questions you might have about IR yourself.
