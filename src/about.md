## Hi, I'm Zoraida!
I've doing photography since my teenage years, but decided to take it a step further in 2018, when I finally bought my first DSLR camera. I then started experimenting with post porcessing, and different types of photography, landscape, macro, portrait, and food photography. Most recently, I took a workshop on infrared (IR) photography, and I was instantly hooked. Photography serves as a creative outlet for me, something that allows me to observe the world in different ways. And IR offered me a whole unseen world. I became even more hooked when I started digging into it. 

You see, I'm a bit of a techy. [I work as a UX Researcher](https://www.zoracabrera.com/) , and ocassionally like to code. And no, no worries, IR photography doesn't involve coding. But it does have a fun techinical side to it! You can, of course, get into it without being too techinical. However, understanding its technical parts opens up so many possibilities. You can probably say that about most types of photography. Yet, I think it rings most true with IR photography. 

### Why this blog
In created this blog to capture my journey as an IR photographer. Along the way, I aim to gather resources that will help others.

### My gear
I keep my gear simple. I don't do this professionally, and this works for me.  
- Non-converted Camera: Canon Rebel T6i 
- IR Camera: Kolari Pocket (just ordered it and its on its way!)
- Tripod: Manfrotto Compact Action

The first IR camera I used was a rented full-spectrum Canon M50 Mark II. I don't currently own this camera.
